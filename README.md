### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media query to modify it for mobile screens

### What I learned

1.Every HTML document should contain h1.
2.It is better to use 'a' tab instead of a 'button' when there is a redirect to another page. 'button' is used for things like submitting forms.
3.I used media query to change the appearance for mobile devices.

### Continued development

Flexbox, CSS Grid.
